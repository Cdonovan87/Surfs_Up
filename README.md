# Surfs_Up
## Overview
For this challenge I was tasked with analysing temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, Hawaii. The end goal of this task was to determine if the clients surf and ice cream business would be able to sustainable throught the year based on the temperatures of the region.
## Results
* Based on the results for both June and December we can determine that both months have a very similar mean/average temperature, June being  around 75 degrees and December being around 71 degrees.
* December has a significantly lower minimum temperature compared to June. December with 56 degrees and june with 64 degrees.
* Both months have a max temperature near each other with December having a max of 83 and June having a max of 85. 
## Summary
Based on the findings of this analysis all the data that was retrieved points towards this business being viable for year round business. This is determined by the similarities between the two months temps which means that Oahu does not seem to have a large variation in its local weather year round. However there are other things besides temperature that could determine whether this business would be able to be open year round. One query I would try is to determine the rainfall for both of those months as consistant precipitation could hamper both the surf side and ice cream side of the business. Another thing I would query is storm/wind data for those months as storms help lead to larger swells in the ocean which inturn leads to more surfers but it could also hamper ice cream sales. Overall, based on the data found in this analysis I would say that the business is viable for year round service.
